== Synopsis

una: Universal un-archiver interface for Mac OS X

Version 1.1, by John Wiegley <johnw@newartisans.com>

This is a "universal" unarchiver for the OS X, written because I'm too lazy
to remember all the testing/listing/extracting options for the large number
of archive formats I come into contact with.

Dependencies:
  StuffIt Expander (free, expander-only version)
  MacPorts: unarj, unrar, lha, lzma, p7zip, cabextract

== Usage

una [OPTION] ARCHIVE...

If no OPTION is specified, the default action is to extract the archive's
contents into the current directory.

Options:
  -h, --help    show help
  -t, --test    test the archive
  -l, --list    list the archive's contents (except StuffIt)

This script is also smart about unarchiving:

  a) if all the contents of an archive would already extract into a single
     directory, do that;

  b) if the archive contains only one item, extract it into the current
     directory;

  c) otherwise, if the archive would dump multiple contents into the current
     directory, create a new directory based on the name of the archive,
     sans extension, and put everything there.
